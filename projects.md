## Detecting Spatiotemporal Traffic Anomalies with Tensor Regression (05/2019 - 09/2019)
Supervised by \textbf{Prof. Lijun Sun}, McGill University

A dynamic framework to model spatiotemporal traffic data to detect anomalous traffic data was proposed in this project. Instead of directly modeling the observed traffic data, we captured system dynamics and temporal dependencies by using a time-varying vector autoregressive (TVAR) model and applied a low-rank tensor structure to model the collection of evolving system matrices. The results show the superiority of the proposed model in uncovering anomalous traffic network dynamics and cannot be achieved by traditional temporal factorization models.


\subsubsection*{B1.2 Anomaly Detection in Land Vehicle Traffic Activity \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad{10/2018 - 04/2019}}

Supervised by \textbf{Prof. Lijun Sun}, McGill University and \textbf{Dr. Antoine Fagette}, Thales Research and Technology Canada 

\noindent\textbf{Description:} the objective of this project is to detect anomaly patterns and build a probabilistic model for a group of vehicles origin and destination based on historical GMTI track data and a priori road network. To address the problem, we applied probabilistic Tucker decomposition to uncover the latent patterns of spatial and temporal dimension and compared the expected values reconstructed from the latent patterns with observations to detect anomalies.

\subsubsection*{B1.3 Forecasting Short-term Subway Ridership under Special Events Scenarios \quad06/2015 - 02/2016}
Supervised by \textbf{Prof. Xiaolei Ma}, Beihang University

\noindent\textbf{Description:} the goal of this project is to predict short-term subway passenger flows under special events scenarios. We constructed the irregular fluctuation of Beijing subway ridership by using multiscale radial basis function (MSRBF) network based on limited passenger flow and applied fuzzy $c$-means algorithm and empirical functions to determine the parameters of MSRBF. To address the scalability problem, the matching pursuit orthogonal least squares algorithm was developed to produce a parsimonious model.


\subsubsection*{B1.4 Epileptic Seizure Detection in EEGs \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\ 02/2015 - 10/2016}
Supervised by\textbf{ Prof. Yang Li}, Beihang University 

\noindent\textbf{Description:} the aim of this project is to achieve an automatic detection framework of epileptic seizures from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We developed an adaptive and localized time-frequency representation in EEG signals by multiscale radial basis functions. The extracted features of EEGs were fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to separate epileptic seizure from seizure-free EEG signals.


\subsubsection*{B1.5 Constructing the Nonlinear System of Hippocampus\qquad\qquad\quad\qquad\quad\quad\quad \ \ 02/2014 - 10/2014}
Supervised by \textbf{Prof. Yang Li}, Beihang University and \textbf{Prof. Rosa H.M. Chan}, City University of Hong Kong 

\noindent\textbf{Description:} we investigated the novel use of Chebyshev polynomials to estimate the changes in model parameters efficiently for time-varying dynamical systems with binary inputs and outputs. This approach can be applied to identify abrupt temporal evaluations of neural dynamics underlying nervous system activity.




\subsubsection*{B1.6 Robust 3D Face Recognition \qquad\qquad\quad\qquad\qquad\quad\qquad\quad\qquad\qquad\quad\quad\quad \ \ 04/2013 - 09/2013}
Supervised by\textbf{ Prof. Kai Liu}, Sichuan University 

\noindent\textbf{Description:} the project is aimed at face recognition based on a 3D face data set. To address the problem, we added a geometric feature to mark the center point based on generally gray degree feature and applied principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm to improve the accuracy of face recognition.


\subsubsection*{B2.1 Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School 2019 \qquad\quad\quad 07/2019 - 08/2019}
Lectures given by: \textbf{Richard Sutton, Yoshua Bengio, Hugo Larochelle, etc.}

\noindent\textbf{Description:} the DLRL Summer School is a part of both the CIFAR Learning in Machines & Brains program and CIFAR Pan-Canadian AI Strategy’s National Program of Activities, and is delivered in partnership with Canada’s three national AI Institutes, Amii, Mila and the Vector Institute. The Summer School covers the basics of deep learning and reinforcement learning, and show its most recent research trends and discoveries in multiple background.
