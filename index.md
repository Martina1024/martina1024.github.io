## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student of Transportation Engineering at McGill University. I received my master degree in Automation from Beihang University, and earned a Bachelor degree in Sichuan University. My current research centers on anomaly detection in spatiotemporal traffic data by low rank decomposition.
